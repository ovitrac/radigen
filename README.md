# Radigen

**Radigen** is a Python-based kernel for simulating radical oxidation mechanisms in complex organic mixtures, including **edible oils**, **biofuels**, and **polymer materials**. It supports the generation, structuring, and numerical resolution of large-scale reaction networks arising from reactive functions and radical-mediated pathways.

## ðŸ§  Core Module: `radigen3.oxidation.py`

This module defines the **combinatorial reaction kernel** and related infrastructure for:

- Reactive species definition with radical and functional group metadata.
- Automatic generation of chemical products using known transformation rules.
- Recursive construction of reaction networks (mono- and bimolecular).
- Canonical fingerprinting of reactions for parameter lookup.
- Association of known reaction rates (`k0`, `Ea`) from literature.
- Internal registry for `reactionRateDB` with confidence intervals and structured querying.
- Support for homolytic and heterolytic decompositions.
- 

## ðŸ§ª Quick Start

```python
from radigen3.oxidation import mixture

oil = mixture()
oil.add("L1H", concentration=3000)       # fatty ester (use P1H for polylers, R1H, R2H, R3H for a generic substance where x in RxH indicates the allicity of the labile proton)
oil.add("L1OOH", concentration=100)      # hydroperoxide
oil.add("O2", concentration=10)          # dissolved oxygen

oil.addProducts()                        # infer and add all products
oil.addReactions()                       # build A+B -> C+D reaction scheme
oil.populateReactionRates()             # populate Ea and k0 from registry
````

`oil.reactions` yields

```
 *R0: L1H + HOâ€¢ -> L1â€¢ + H2O
 *R1: L1H + L1Oâ€¢ -> L1â€¢ + L1OH
 *R2: L1H + L1OOâ€¢ -> L1â€¢ + L1OOH
 *R3: L1OOH -> L1Oâ€¢ + HOâ€¢
 *R4: L1OOH + L1OOH -> L1Oâ€¢ + L1OOâ€¢
 *R5: L1â€¢ + O2 -> L1OOâ€¢
 *R6: L1â€¢ + L1â€¢ -> L1-polymer + L1-polymer
 *R7: L1â€¢ + L1OOâ€¢ -> L1-polymer + L1-polymer
 *R8: L1Oâ€¢ -> L1=O
 *R9: L1OOâ€¢ + L1OOâ€¢ -> L1-polymer + L1-polymer
```

where `*` indicates that the reaction has been parameterized
